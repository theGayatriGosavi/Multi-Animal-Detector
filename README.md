# Multi Animal Detector
An Image classification project that utilizes a pre-trained ResNet-18 model to identify various animals in images. The application can predict individual animals and can be modified to detect multiple animals in a single image.

## Features
- **Image Classification**: Classifies images of animals into predefined categories.
- **User-Friendly GUI**: Simple interface for users to upload images and view predictions.
- **Pre-trained Model**: Utilizes ResNet-18 for efficient and accurate predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Programming language used for the project.
- **PyTorch**: Framework for building and training deep learning models.
- **Torchvision**: Library for image processing and pre-trained models.
- **Tkinter**: GUI toolkit for creating the application interface.

## Dataset 
The model is trained on the Animals-10 dataset, which includes images of various animals, such as:
- Dog (Cane)
- Cat (Gatto)
- Elephant (Elefante)
- Horse (Cavallo)
- Butterfly (Farfalla)
- Chicken (Gallina)
- Cow (Mucca)
- Sheep (Pecora)
- Squirrel (Scoiattolo)
- Spider (Ragno)
